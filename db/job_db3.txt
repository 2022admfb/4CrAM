//================================
// 4th Jobs
// Note: A tool was used to convert the tables shown on kRO's site to a usable format.
// Sadly there's quite a lot of error's on what the site shows as its not possible to get more then 1
// trait bonus stat per job level and thus the tool ends up missing on a lot of bonus stat placements.
// Even I can't tell where they go. Congrats gravity for screwing up on every table shown on your site.
